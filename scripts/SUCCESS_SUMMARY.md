# 🎉 Dummy Data Generation - SUCCESS!

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

Your Supabase database now contains **comprehensive test data** for your ACU Apex application!

### 📊 Data Summary

**Companies Created:**
- ✅ Alpha Company (4 students)
- ✅ Bravo Company (4 students) 
- ✅ Charlie Company (4 students)
- ✅ Delta Company (4 students)
- ✅ Echo Company (4 students)

**Students Created:**
- ✅ **20 new student users** with realistic profiles
- ✅ **Complete user profiles** including names, emails, phone numbers
- ✅ **Personality profiles** (DISC, Myers-Briggs, Enneagram)
- ✅ **Academic information** (roles, years, student IDs)
- ✅ **Company assignments** (evenly distributed across companies)

### 🔐 Authentication Details

All students were created with:
- **Email addresses**: `@acu.edu` domain (e.g., `Elyse_Kunde0@acu.edu`)
- **Default password**: `password123` (for testing purposes)
- **Email confirmation**: Automatically confirmed
- **User metadata**: Includes first name, last name, and role

## 🚀 How to Use the Data

### For Testing
1. **Login as any student** using their email and password `password123`
2. **Test company features** - each company has 4 students
3. **Test student profiles** - all have complete personality and academic data
4. **Test company assignments** - students are properly linked to companies

### Sample Student Credentials
```
Email: Elyse_Kunde0@acu.edu
Password: password123

Email: Fay_Bayer@acu.edu  
Password: password123

Email: Makenzie_Ratke@acu.edu
Password: password123
```

- ✅ Will only create new data if needed

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test your application** with the new dummy data
2. **Verify company assignments** work correctly
3. **Test student profiles** and data display
4. **Use the data** for development and testing
5. **Modify the script** if you need different test data
