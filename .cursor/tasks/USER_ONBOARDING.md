- [ ] Add staff-specific onboarding flow variations
- [ ] Ensure staff users route to staff page after onboarding completion

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Decisions

**Local Storage Strategy**: Use localStorage with JSON serialization for onboarding data persistence. This provides simple implementation while maintaining data between screen navigation without complex state management.

**Route Structure**: Use Next.js route groups `(onboarding)` to create isolated onboarding flow that doesn't interfere with main app routing.

**Role-Based Routing**: Implement conditional routing logic based on selected role to skip irrelevant screens (e.g., company selection for staff).

**Data Validation**: Implement both client-side validation for UX and server-side validation during final sync for security.

**Error Handling**: Provide graceful degradation and retry mechanisms for network failures during final sync.

### Technical Components

1. **OnboardingProvider**: React context for managing onboarding state and local storage operations
2. **OnboardingLayout**: Common layout with progress indicators and navigation
3. **Form Components**: Reusable form components with validation and local storage integration
4. **Role-based Conditional Rendering**: Components that adapt based on selected user role
5. **Sync Service**: Utility for batch uploading all onboarding data to Supabase

### Data Flow

1. User completes authentication
2. AuthProvider checks `has_completed_onboarding` status
3. If false, redirect to `/role-selection`
4. Each onboarding screen saves data to localStorage
5. Role selection determines which screens to show
6. Final screen syncs all data to USERS table
7. Mark onboarding complete and redirect to appropriate dashboard

### Key User Experience Considerations

- **Progress Indication**: Show users where they are in the onboarding process
- **Data Persistence**: Never lose user input due to navigation or refresh
- **Conditional Flows**: Only show relevant screens based on role selection
- **Graceful Errors**: Handle network issues and provide clear error messages
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all forms and interactions are accessible
- **Pre-populated Data**: Email field should be pre-filled from authentication data
- **Required Field Validation**: Clear indication of required vs optional fields
