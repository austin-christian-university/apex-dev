## Implementation Plan

The database schema will be implemented in 12 phases, starting with core entities and building up to complex business logic functions. Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next phase.

### Architecture Overview
- **Core Entities**: Users, Companies, Students with proper relationships
- **Holistic GPA System**: Categories, Subcategories, Scores with flexible weighting
- **Event System**: Events and submissions with role-based filtering
- **Academic System**: Classes and records with Populi integration
- **Competition System**: Company standings and scores with historical tracking
- **Additional Data**: Financial records, personality profiles, student profiles
- **Business Logic**: Functions and triggers for automated calculations
- **Security**: Comprehensive RLS policies for role-based access
- **Performance**: Strategic indexing for optimal query performance

### Data Flow
1. User authentication through Supabase Auth
2. Role-based access to different data sets
3. Event-driven score updates through submissions
4. Automated GPA calculations and company standings
5. Historical tracking of all changes
6. Integration with Populi for academic and financial data

### Technical Components
- **Supabase PostgreSQL**: Primary database with advanced features
- **Row Level Security**: Fine-grained access control
- **JSONB Fields**: Flexible data storage for events and profiles
- **Triggers**: Automated audit trail and calculations
- **Functions**: Complex business logic for GPA calculations
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization for common queries

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local Supabase instance for testing
- **Staging**: Supabase project for integration testing
- **Production**: Supabase project with proper security policies
- **Backup**: Automated backups and disaster recovery procedures
