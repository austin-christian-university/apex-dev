# Authentication System Implementation

Complete setup of Supabase authentication system with proper folder structure, auth provider, and login functionality matching the previous working implementation.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Basic Supabase client setup
- [x] Initial login dialog component
- [x] Auth callback route handler
- [x] Error page for auth errors
- [x] Middleware for session management

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Test complete authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Add protected route patterns (middleware integration)
- [x] Fix redirect bug after successful login

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Optimize auth state management
- [ ] Add better loading states and error boundaries
- [ ] Implement proper redirect handling for protected routes
- [ ] Add remember me functionality
- [ ] Implement password reset flow

## Recently Completed Tasks

- [x] Organize auth components into proper folder structure
- [x] Create AuthProvider component matching previous app
- [x] Fix Supabase import paths consistency  
- [x] Update dashboard to use auth provider instead of actions
- [x] Add auth provider to root layout
- [x] Implement sign-out functionality through auth provider
- [x] Add loading states and proper user management
- [x] Fix build errors and import issues
- [x] Fix redirect bug after successful login
- [x] Implement centralized auth state management with automatic redirects

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Folder Structure Reorganization
Move all auth-related components to `components/auth/` subfolder:
- `components/auth/auth-provider.tsx` - Context provider for auth state
- `components/auth/login-dialog.tsx` - Login/signup dialog component
- `components/auth/protected-route.tsx` - Route protection wrapper (future)

### 2. Supabase Path Consistency
Decide on single import path pattern:
- Current: `@/lib/supabase/client`
- Previous app: `@/utils/supabase/client`
- Decision: Use `@/lib/supabase/` to match current Next.js best practices

### 3. Auth Provider Implementation
Create React context provider that:
- Manages user authentication state
- Handles sign-in/sign-out actions
- Provides loading states
- Listens to auth state changes
- Exposes user data and auth methods

### 4. Dashboard Integration
Update dashboard to:
- Use auth provider context instead of server actions
- Handle sign-out through context
- Show proper loading states
- Redirect unauthenticated users appropriately

## Architecture Decisions

### Authentication Flow
1. **Client-side auth state management** via React Context
2. **Server-side session validation** in middleware and protected routes
3. **Hybrid approach** - client context for UI state, server validation for security

### Component Structure
- **AuthProvider** - Root context provider with user state
- **LoginDialog** - Reusable modal for authentication
- **useAuth** - Custom hook for accessing auth context
- **Protected routes** - HOC or component for route protection

### State Management
- User object and loading state in React Context
- Session cookies managed by Supabase SSR
- Automatic auth state synchronization between client/server

## Error Resolution

### Build Error Fix
The dashboard page imports missing `'../auth/actions'` file that was deleted.
**Solution**: Update dashboard to use auth provider context instead of server actions.

### Import Path Consistency  
Multiple Supabase import paths exist (`@/lib/supabase/` vs `@/utils/supabase/`).
**Solution**: Standardize on `@/lib/supabase/` pattern throughout the app.
