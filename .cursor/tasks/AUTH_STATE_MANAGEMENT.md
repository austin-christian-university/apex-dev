# Authentication State Management Fix

Investigation and resolution of the login redirect issue where users get stuck on `/login` route showing "Redirecting to dashboard..." after successful authentication.

## Problem Analysis

The user can successfully authenticate with Supabase, but the application fails to redirect from `/login` to `/dashboard` after authentication. The login dialog works correctly and updates the auth state, but the redirect mechanism is not functioning properly.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Initial problem assessment
- [x] Investigate current authentication flow
- [x] Test authentication with Playwright
- [x] Identify the root cause of redirect failure
- [x] Fix authentication state management
- [x] Implement proper redirect mechanism
- [x] Test the complete authentication flow
- [x] Verify the fix works correctly

## Root Cause Identified

The issue was caused by **a redirect loop** in the authentication flow:

1. **Login Dialog Issue**: When the login dialog opened on `/login`, it saved `/login` as the `authRedirectPath` in localStorage
2. **Redirect Loop**: After successful authentication, the auth provider tried to redirect to the saved path, which was `/login`, creating an infinite loop
3. **Additional Issues**: 
   - TypeScript errors preventing proper compilation (Next.js 15 `searchParams` format)
   - Font configuration errors in layout.tsx

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Login Dialog Redirect Path Logic
**File**: `apps/web/components/auth/login-dialog.tsx`
```typescript
// Before (causing loop)
localStorage.setItem('authRedirectPath', pathname || '/')

// After (fixed)
const redirectPath = pathname === '/login' || pathname === '/' ? '/dashboard' : pathname
localStorage.setItem('authRedirectPath', redirectPath)
```

### 2. Enhanced Auth Provider Debugging
**File**: `apps/web/components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`
- Fixed malformed indentation in redirect logic
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added setTimeout to prevent race conditions
- Fixed TypeScript router.push() type error

### 3. Fixed Next.js 15 Compatibility Issues
**File**: `apps/web/app/error/page.tsx`
- Updated `searchParams` to be async compatible with Next.js 15

**File**: `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`  
- Removed undefined `fontSans` reference
- Simplified to use CSS custom properties for fonts

## Test Results

✅ **Authentication Flow Now Works Correctly**:
1. User enters credentials on login page
2. Supabase authentication succeeds
3. Auth state change triggers
4. Redirect path correctly set to `/dashboard` (not `/login`)
5. Router successfully navigates to dashboard
6. Dashboard loads with user data
7. No more redirect loops

## Implementation Details

### Current Auth Flow (Fixed)
- Login dialog updates Supabase auth state ✅
- Auth provider listens to state changes ✅
- Redirect path correctly set to avoid loops ✅
- Router.push() executes successfully ✅
- User sees dashboard interface ✅

### Console Log Evidence
```
[LOG] Auth state changed: {newUser: true, pathname: /login}
[LOG] User authenticated, checking if on login page: true
[LOG] Attempting redirect to: /dashboard    // ✅ Fixed: was /login before
[LOG] Auth state changed: {newUser: true, pathname: /dashboard}
[LOG] User authenticated, checking if on login page: false
```
