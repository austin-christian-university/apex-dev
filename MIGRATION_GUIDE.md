# Monorepo Migration Guide

## What Was Accomplished

Your existing Next.js web application has been successfully transformed into a monorepo structure using **Turborepo** and **pnpm workspaces**. Here's what was set up:

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Monorepo Structure Created**
   - Root configuration with Turborepo
   - pnpm workspace setup
   - Shared TypeScript configuration
   - Comprehensive .gitignore

2. **Web App Migration** (`apps/web`)
   - Moved existing Next.js app to `apps/web/`
   - Updated package.json with workspace dependencies
   - Configured TypeScript paths for shared packages

3. **Shared Packages Created**
   - **`packages/types`**: Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
   - **`packages/utils`**: Common utility functions
   - **`packages/ui`**: Shared UI components (moved from existing components/ui)
   - **`packages/config`**: Shared ESLint, TypeScript, and Tailwind configurations

4. **Backend Service** (`services/students-api`)
   - Express.js API service
   - Converted existing Next.js API routes to Express endpoints
   - Added proper validation with Zod
   - Health check endpoint

5. **Mobile App Placeholder** (`apps/mobile`)
   - Expo configuration
   - Basic package.json setup
   - Ready for React Native development

6. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflows for CI and deployment
   - Type checking, linting, and building
   - Deployment configuration for Vercel

7. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README.md
   - Migration guide (this file)

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Test the Setup**
   ```bash
   # Start the web app
   pnpm --filter @acu-apex/web dev
   
   # Start the API service
   pnpm --filter @acu-apex/students-api dev
   ```

3. **Update Import Paths**
   - Update imports in your web app to use the new shared packages
   - Replace direct imports with workspace package imports

### Code Updates Needed

1. **Update Web App Imports**
   ```typescript
   // Before
   import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
   import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
   
   // After
   import { cn } from "@acu-apex/utils"
   import { Button } from "@acu-apex/ui"
   ```

2. **Update Type Imports**
   ```typescript
   // Before
   import type { Student } from "@/lib/data"
   
   // After
   import type { Student } from "@acu-apex/types"
   ```

3. **Update API Calls**
   - Update API endpoints to point to the new Express service
   - Update from `/api/students` to `http://localhost:3001/api/students`

### Environment Configuration

1. **Create Environment Files**
   ```bash
   # Root .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   
   # API service .env
   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

2. **Update API Configuration**
   - Update the web app to use environment variables for API URLs
   - Configure CORS in the API service for production

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   pnpm dev
   
   # Or start individually
   pnpm --filter @acu-apex/web dev
   pnpm --filter @acu-apex/students-api dev
   ```

2. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Build all packages
   pnpm build
   
   # Deploy specific apps
   pnpm --filter @acu-apex/web build
   pnpm --filter @acu-apex/students-api build
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits

### What You've Gained

1. **Code Sharing**: UI components, utilities, and types are now shared across apps
2. **Consistent Tooling**: Unified ESLint, TypeScript, and build configurations
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new apps and services
4. **Performance**: Turborepo provides intelligent caching and parallel builds
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized dependency management and configurations

### Future Expansion

1. **Add More Services**
   - Authentication API
   - Scores API
   - File upload service
   - Analytics service

2. **Add More Apps**
   - Admin dashboard
   - Mobile app (React Native)
   - Desktop app (Electron)

3. **Add More Packages**
   - Database client
   - API client
   - Testing utilities
   - Storybook components

## üö® Important Notes

### Breaking Changes
- API endpoints have moved from Next.js routes to Express services
- Import paths have changed to use workspace packages
- Some dependencies may need to be reinstalled

### Migration Checklist
- [ ] Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
- [ ] Test web app functionality
- [ ] Test API service endpoints
- [ ] Update import statements
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test build process
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment

### Troubleshooting

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure all packages are properly exported from their index files
2. **Build Errors**: Check that all workspace dependencies are correctly specified
3. **Type Errors**: Ensure TypeScript configurations are properly extended
4. **API Errors**: Verify that the API service is running and accessible

## üéØ Success Metrics

Your monorepo is successfully set up when:
- ‚úÖ All applications build without errors
- ‚úÖ Shared packages are properly imported
- ‚úÖ API services respond correctly
- ‚úÖ Development workflow is smooth
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline passes

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues during the migration:
1. Check the README.md for detailed setup instructions
2. Review the package.json files for correct dependencies
3. Verify TypeScript configurations are properly extended
4. Ensure all workspace packages are correctly referenced

The monorepo structure is now ready for development and will scale with your application needs!
